## Dangerous Games ##
## Part 1: Dragons ##
#### Stage 1: Bar Event ####
dg_dr_stg1_prompt=The moment you pass through the bar door, a strong drink is pressed into your hand. You look at it, dumbfounded, and then look up to the waiter who gave it to you. "Compliments of Mr. Karengo," he says, nodding his head towards a crowd of people, mostly young men, before moving on.
dg_dr_stg1_startBarEvent=Head over to "Mr. Karengo"
dg_dr_stg1_pg1_onShown=As you make your way over, you note that nearly everyone in the bar has the same drink you do. In the middle of the crowd, a large, heavily muscled, and tattooed man is gesticulating wildly, apparently telling a story.
dg_dr_stg1_pg1_opt1=Go listen to the man
dg_dr_stg1_pg1_opt2=Leave
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_para1="...so then he says to me, he says, have you ever ridden one? And I look back at this crazy joithead and I say, you're a crazy joithead. "But he's got me thinking, y'know? Nobody has ever ridden one. Least, not nobody that could talk after." He lets out a laugh. "So I ask you all; who wants to join Karengo to make history? Who wants to ride a dragon?"
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_para2=You've heard the stories of the dragons of <mark>${dragonPlanet}</mark> as a child; great beasts that control the skies, astonishingly similar to the dragons of lore. The galaxy is host to many dangerous creatures, but these living myths hold a special place near the top of that list.
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_para3=A cheer goes up from the men, especially the drunk ones, and "Mr. Karengo" starts to hand out death and accident waivers and collect money for the expedition. Suddenly, he cocks his head, listening to an earpiece, and his face changes. "Listen up!" he yells, "Seems my regular pilot got in the way of a pirate fleet, and my replacement pilot misplaced his balls this evening and can't find 'em! So we need ourselves a ship and a captain to <mark>${dragonPlanet}</mark>! Who's ready to pay for their drink?"
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_opt1="Captain ${playerLastName}, at your service. We leave at dawn!"
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_opt2=Stay silent
dg_dr_stg1_pg3_onShown=You wake up significantly after dawn with empty bottles and unconscious men strewn all over your ship. Karengo gives you a crooked smile, shielding his eyes from the light. "Alright, ${playerLastName}," he says, "let's do this."
dg_dr_stg1_pg3_opt1=Leave

dg_dr_intel_desc_stg-done=The surviving men were returned home, having gotten more adventure than they bargained for.
dg_dr_intel_desc_stg-failedByAbandon=You abandoned the Dragonriders to their deaths on ${dragonPlanet}
#
#### Stage 2: Arrival at planet ####
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para1=The men load into a shuttle and Karengo directs you down through the atmosphere of ${dragonPlanet}${ifColonized}. As you're putting down in a clearing halfway up a mountain, there's an otherworldly screech and your ship lurches violently to one side. If you hadn't been strapped in, you would have been thrown to the floor.
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para1_ifColonized=, steering clear of the usual tourist areas and, you realize, of the local law enforcement
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para2="Look lively, boys!" Karengo is the only person still standing. "Your chariot awaits!" In short order, he double-checks the jetpacks on the backs of each of the men, or "Dragonriders", as they creatively branded themselves during their first night of the voyage. Karengo opens the side hatch and hurls the Dragonriders out the door before himself following.
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para3=You land and pull up every external camera you have to watch the action.
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_opt1=Continue
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_para1=The dragons of ${dragonPlanet} you saw as a kid were different from the dragons of mythology, but the beasts you see today aren't quite the same ones you remember learning about on "The Xenofauna Channel", either. For one, the creatures outside your window are largely invisible - a trick of the way the light reflects around the scales on their hides. They are faster, too, or perhaps the ones on "Xenofauna" had been drugged to make them easier to film. A quick survey of the scene shows that Karengo has tagged three dragons with some sort of paintball gun to make them easier to track. Eight of the Dragonriders are chasing the largest one, which is missing part of a tooth and has some blackened scales from where it hit your shield. The last Dragonrider is nowhere in sight.
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_para2=Suddenly, proximity sensors go off on the starboard side and a camera shows something - or someone - bounce off your shield and tumble down the mountainside.
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_opt1=Announce that you're leaving
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_opt2=Stay
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_opt3=Take off, leaving everybody else behind
dg_dr_stg2_pg3_para1=Upon closer inspection, the object rolling down the hill is indeed a body. You turn away and back to the monitors, where one of the Dragonriders is keeping just above a dragon, attempting to lower himself down. The dragon rolls in midair, its wing catching the man and sending him flying. Fortunately for him, a leafy tree branch prevents any further physical harm. Meanwhile, a second dragon is pursuing another Dragonrider.
dg_dr_stg2_pg3_opt1=Get everyone out of there
dg_dr_stg2_pg3_opt2=Take off, leaving everybody else behind
dg_dr_stg2_pg-abandon_para1="The ship takes off with a roar at your touch. Between the cries of the dragons, the sound of the engines, and the air rushing past, you can barely hear the fear and betrayal in the voices of the men you've left behind.
dg_dr_stg2_pg-abandon_opt1=Exit
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_para1=You turn on the PA system. "WE ARE LEAVING," you blast to the survivors, "GET ON BOARD."
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_para2=The defeated Dragonriders need no further encouragement. They beeline for the hatch and you drop a section of the shield to let them through, where they collapse, wide-eyed and panting. Karengo isn't with them. You turn to ask about him, when a flicker of motion on a monitor catches your eye.
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_para3=Karengo is there, and he's riding a dragon, gripping the ridge of scales around its neck. The dragon is frantically trying to get him off, but creative application of his jetpack is, for now, keeping him on top of the beast. He lets out wild whoops of triumph as they soar through the sky and at last you can understand the appeal of this whole mission. Your admiration is cut short by two catastrophic crashes on either side of the ship and accompanying sirens. The dragons are trying to get through.
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_opt1=Take off
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_opt2=Swear and take off
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_opt2_para1="Pignuts," you mutter to yourself.
dg_dr_stg2_pg5_para1=The ship takes off quickly enough to make you temporarily light-headed. "GET ON!" shouts one of the men over the PA as you position the ship just below the raging dragon with Karengo attached. Scales bounce off the roof like diamonds. He lets go of his death grip on the dragon and free falls toward you, only slowing at the last possible moment before dropping through the top hatch. You hit the engines hard and they respond enthusiastically, rocketing you away from the mountain${ifColonized}. From the cabin comes the sound of back-slapping and, surprisingly, a sob.
dg_dr_stg2_pg5_para1_ifColonized=\ and into the safety of patrolled airspace
dg_dr_stg2_pg5_opt1=Leave to take the men back home
#
#### Stage 3: Back Home ####
dg_dr_stg3_pg1_para1=As you land and fuel up, Karengo herds the seven surviving men out of the ship. "Meet us at the bar, yeah?" he says to you. "This day deserves a celebration." You nod, but can't help but notice red eyes and wet cheeks among the rest of the Dragonriders as they shuffle off.
dg_dr_stg3_pg1_opt1=Continue
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_para1=Later that day, you spot the Dragonriders at a corner table of the bar. The men, with the exception of Karengo, appear subdued.
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_para2="How goes it, ${playerLastName}?" he asks. "We were just raising a glass to mission success - made possible by you, of course. Great flying, brother." The bartender arrives with a round of drinks and Karengo raises one. "To the Dragonriders!" he says.
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt1="To the Dragonriders!"
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt2="To our fallen friends!"
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt2_para1=Karengo gives you an unreadable look and lowers his glass.
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt3="I'm good, thanks."
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt3_para1=Karengo gives you an unreadable look and lowers his glass.
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_para1="Your payment, plus Bolek and Jarek's signup fees. ${rewardCredits}."
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_opt1="Thanks."
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_opt2="I can't accept their money. It's not right."
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_opt2_para1=Karengo shrugs and doesn't take it back.
dg_dr_stg3_pg4_para1="Maybe I'll see you again sometime, yeah? I'm in need of a pilot with some guts." He nods in your direction, clearly dismissing you.
dg_dr_stg3_pg4_para1_opt1=Leave

dd_de_intel_title_stg-done=Finished: Brought Karengo and crew to search for underwater treasure.
#
#### Stage 1: Bar Event ####
dg_de_stg1_prompt=A boisterous laugh sounds from somewhere behind you. You haven't heard that voice since your ship was attacked by dragons.
dg_de_stg1_startBarEvent=Look around for Karengo
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para1="${playerFirstName}!" A huge hand claps you on the shoulder and spins you around, where you find yourself facing a large, widely grinning man.
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para2="Remember me? Yer the best pilot I've had - that stunt to get us out of ${dragonPlanet}, right out of the dragon's nest? Epic."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para3=A crude, but professional, sign behind him reads, 'Dangerous Games - Karengo's Galactic Adventures'.
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para4="Like it?" Karengo follows your gaze. "Decided to make this an official thing. Well...an unofficial official thing.\nFeds wouldn't understand. Doesn't matter; I need a pilot again, and a good one. You've got a waterproof lander, right?"
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt1="Uh, yeah. I think so."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt2="Of course."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt3="Sorry, mate. You'll have to find another pilot."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_para1=Karengo laughs. "It handles the vacuum of space, yeah? Yer right, it'll be fine. I've got a group of lads and ladies here rarin' to see some quoijuu in heat, right up close'n'personal. They've all got their own subpods, so how's about we load up and head out in the next few hours. Good? Good."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_para2="Oh, nearly forgot. We're headed to <mark>${depthsPlanet}</mark>, in <mark>${depthsSystem}</mark>. Ain't sure who's in charge over there these days, so we might need to grease some palms. Best to keep your eyes open and shields up."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_opt1="We leave at noon!"
#
#### Stage 2: Arrival ####
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para1=As before, on ${dragonPlanet}, Karengo guides you down to a landing spot far away from the local government${ifPlayerOwnedWorld}. "Don't want no interruptions," he says.
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para1_ifPlayerOwnedWorld=, despite your assurances that you control the local government
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para2=Despite days of pressuring, you've been unable to get Karengo to tell you exactly what a quoijuu is, other than the slightly ominous, "the biggest fish". He sends a file to your ship computer and grins. "Since it's too late to back out now, it's time to fill you in. Quoijuu aren't the only thing down there; you've also got scyllae, taniwhales, morgawrii, plus some hydrothermal vents, none of which will benefit us if we run into them.
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para3=The good news is that there is a path to follow. The bad news is that the only person to make the path public was a bit of a nut. It's all in riddles, and I haven't been able to make head nor tail of them. Look them over and we'll follow your lead. And don't worry too much about it - what's the worst that could happen?"
dg_de_stg2_pg1_opt1="Ok, I'll take a look"
dg_de_stg2_pg1_opt2="We could get lost and then die"
dg_de_stg2_pg1_opt2_onSelected=Karengo smiles in a way that is only reminiscent of reassuring.
dg_de_stg2_pg2_para1=The adventure seekers, who you've spent the trip getting to know, are getting ready. You watch a nearby pair, Daciana and Mussie, helping each other out to put on wetsuits, when Daciana catches your gaze and grins. "Bafta, mate. Safe sailing, see you on the other side." Karengo gives you a signal and you hurry back to the cockpit to fly out, away from safe shoals and over the watery abyss.
dg_de_stg2_pg2_para2=At your touch, the <ship> slowly sinks below the waves. As Karengo warned you about on the way over, most of your navigation systems quickly flash red warnings and go offline; there is some unknown interference that overwhelm your poor ship's sensors, which were designed for space first and water second, or fifth, or not at all. Minutes tick by as the crew silently watches one of the few sensors still working. A young couple, Balazs and Jorma, uneasily exchange glances.
dg_de_stg2_pg2_opt1=Continue
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para1=EIGHT KILOMETERS, the depth meter reads. TEN KILOMETERS. SIXTEEN KILOMETERS. A loud, metallic creak echoes through the ship and Mussie jumps, startled.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para2=Karengo claps him on the back and gives him a signature grin. "Maybe ${playerFirstName} can keep you aboard after this in case he needs anything from a high shelf!" Mussie smiles weakly, but his eyes don't leave the readout.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para3=TWENTY-FIVE KILOMETERS. "This's it," Karengo announces, "Sub up! Let's see what there is to see. And ${playerFirstName}, keep it to passive sensors. Don't want to attract any undue attention." The ship smoothly descends into the mouth of a massive cave and your visibility, clouded by dark sulfide emissions from the hydrothermal vents at the floor, drops to less than eight meters. A fan of 10 personal subpods fan out behind you, their communication equipment syncing with yours to display them as blips on your screen.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para4="Ok ${playerFirstName}," Karengo crackles over the radio. "Lead on."

##### Riddle 1 #####
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_para1=No other path may you take\nOiled skins flash and flicker\nRazer spikes grow from the deep\nTitanic walls crush and smash\nHeed the beginnings to live.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optEast=Go East
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optNorth=Go North
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optSouth=Go South
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optWest=Go West
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the east. Out of the darkness, some sort of small whale crashes into your ship, setting off a couple of proximity alarms but causing no damage. It isn't until you hear screaming, distorted by the speakers, that it becomes clear what you just saw; the "small whale" was a just a flipper of something much, much larger.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_para2="Morgawrii!" shouts Karengo, "Turn around! Turn around!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_opt1=Turn around
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_opt1_onSelected=Hauling on the controls, you spin your ship around. Leviathan shapes rise from below, stirring the water around your ship as it speeds to safety.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the south. The swirling clouds of emissions seem to get thicker and thicker, until there's no reason to look at anything but the ship compass. The screen beeps once and a blip disappears.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_para2="Elias?" Karengo asks. "Your transmitter just cut out." When there's no response, he swears. "Everybody go back." he broadcasts. "Something's wrong."
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_opt1_onSelected=You spin your ship around and hear a loud crunch come from outside - your shields have just impacted something large and solid. The outer lights shine off falling stone and it suddenly it all comes together; you've led everybody through a field of hydrothermal vents that rise for tens of meters off the bottom, obscured by their own noxious clouds. You guide your ship back to safety, toppling more underwater smokestacks as you go.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the west. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, ${playerFirstName}. Looks like this is the way forward."
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_para2="Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Elias, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by others'.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_para3=Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off at the same time your outer lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see. "Stop!" shouts Karengo, "It's the end of the cavern! Stop and go back!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_opt1_onSelected=Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the endless stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_failure_para1=A quick roll call shows two subpods missing; Elias and Taddese never made it back.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_failure_para2=A voice crackles over the radio, "It's clear up north!" Somebody, no doubt unimpressed by your navigating, has scouted ahead and found a way though.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_failure_opt1=Open the next riddle
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_north_para1=You turn the ship to the north and glide it through the abyssal depths. The subpods race forward, each vying to outdo the other, seemingly heedless of the dangers that Karengo hinted at. With bated breath, you watch the sensors until at last the comms flare.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_north_para2="Woah!" comes Karengo's voice. "I think that's far enough. Which way to we go next, ${playerFirstName}?"
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_north_opt1=Open the next riddle
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_para1=There are stingers in the deep\nA certain death, a dreamless sleep.\nGo to beast that has no bee\nNo danger there, just open sea.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_optEast=Go East
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_optNorth=Go North
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_optWest=Go West
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_para1=Bubbles rush past the thick windows as the group's subpods scout to the north at your direction. At first, all is quiet. Just as you start to exhale a sigh of relief, twin lightning bolts arc across the waterscape ahead and the ship sensors overload, blinded by an apparent release of electricity. The systems recover, showing subpods returning quickly back to the ship.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_para2=One is missing; Mussie.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_opt1_onSelected=You turn the ship back the way you came and pull up the sensor recording to see what happened. The flash of light came from viney seaweed, stretching as far up and down as the ship can detect. Evidently, contact with it released a jolt of electricity that lit up both the vine and Mussie's subpod.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the west. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, ${playerFirstName}. Looks like this is the way forward."
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_para2="Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Mussie, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by others'.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_para3=Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off at the same time your outer lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see. "Stop!" shouts Karengo, "It's the end of the cavern! Stop and go back!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_opt1_onSelected=Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the endless stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_2ndWallCrash_para1=No no no...not again. The proximity alarm wails and this time, you're much quicker to stop the ship...but Mussie isn't so lucky. His subpod smashes straight into a different stretch of the same rock wall that claimed Elias and Taddese not minutes before.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_2ndWallCrash_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_2ndWallCrash_opt1_onSelected=Again, you put the ship into reverse and turn around. This is not going at all how it was supposed to.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_firstFail_para1=Karengo sounds a roll call over the radio. Mussie never reports in, and his subpod beacon isn't responding. "Ah, well." says Karengo, without much sympathy. "You all stay here and I'll scout ahead."
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_firstFail_para2=Only minutes later, he's found a clear path east, and you morosly trail the ship behind.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_secondFail_para1=Karengo sounds a roll call over the radio. Elias and Taddese are still missing, and now Mussie has failed to report in as well. None of their subpod beacons are responding.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_secondFail_para2="Ah, well." says Karengo, without much sympathy. "You all stay here and I'll scout ahead." Only minutes later, he's found a clear path east, and you morosly trail the ship behind.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_opt1=Open the next riddle
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_firstSuccess_para1=Cautiously, you turn to the east and power forward. Subpods fly ahead, exulting in their agility in the face of the dangerous ocean.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_firstSuccess_para2=After holding your breath for what feels like hours, Karengo radios you. "Knew you'd find your way eventually. What's the next direction?"
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_firstSuccess_opt1=Open the next riddle
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_secondSuccess_para1="A bee-less beast," you mutter to yourself. "A poet, this writer was not." Turning east, the ship powers forward, cautious but confident.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_secondSuccess_para2=Subpods fly ahead, exulting in their agility in the face of the dangerous ocean. It isn't long until Karengo again radios you. "Knew I chose ya for a reason. What's the next direction?"

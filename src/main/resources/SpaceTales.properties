## Part 1: Dragons ##
#### Stage 1: Bar Event ####
dd_dr_stg1_prompt=The moment you pass through the bar door, a strong drink is pressed into your hand. You look at it, dumbfounded, and then look up to the waiter who gave it to you. "Compliments of Mr. Karengo," he says, nodding his head towards a crowd of people, mostly young men, before moving on.
dd_dr_stg1_startBarEvent=Head over to "Mr. Karengo"
dd_dr_stg1_pg1_onShown=As you make your way over, you note that nearly everyone in the bar has the same drink you do. In the middle of the crowd, a large, heavily muscled, and tattooed man is gesticulating wildly, apparently telling a story.
dd_dr_stg1_pg1_opt1=Go listen to the man
dd_dr_stg1_pg1_opt2=Leave
dd_dr_stg1_pg2_para1="...so then he says to me, he says, have you ever ridden one? And I look back at this crazy joithead and I say, you're a crazy joithead. "But he's got me thinking, y'know? Nobody has ever ridden one. Least, not nobody that could talk after." He lets out a laugh. "So I ask you all; who wants to join Karengo to make history? Who wants to ride a dragon?"
dd_dr_stg1_pg2_para2=You've heard the stories of the dragons of <mark>${dragonPlanet}</mark> as a child; great beasts that control the skies, astonishingly similar to the dragons of lore. The galaxy is host to many dangerous creatures, but these living myths hold a special place near the top of that list.
dd_dr_stg1_pg2_para3=A cheer goes up from the men, especially the drunk ones, and "Mr. Karengo" starts to hand out death and accident waivers and collect money for the expedition. Suddenly, he cocks his head, listening to an earpiece, and his face changes. "Listen up!" he yells, "Seems my regular pilot got in the way of a pirate fleet, and my replacement pilot misplaced his balls this evening and can't find 'em! So we need ourselves a ship and a captain to <mark>${dragonPlanet}</mark>! Who's ready to pay for their drink?"
dd_dr_stg1_pg2_opt1="Captain ${playerLastName}, at your service. We leave at dawn!"
dd_dr_stg1_pg2_opt2=Stay silent
dd_dr_stg1_pg3_onShown=You wake up significantly after dawn with empty bottles and unconscious men strewn all over your ship. Karengo gives you a crooked smile, shielding his eyes from the light. "Alright, ${playerLastName}," he says, "let's do this."
dd_dr_stg1_pg3_opt1=Leave

#
#### Stage 2: Arrival at planet ####
dd_dr_stg2_pg1_para1=The men load into a shuttle and Karengo directs you down through the atmosphere of ${planetName}${ifColonized}. As you're putting down in a clearing halfway up a mountain, there's an otherworldly screech and your ship lurches violently to one side. If you hadn't been strapped in, you would have been thrown to the floor.
dd_dr_stg2_pg1_para1_ifColonized=, steering clear of the usual tourist areas and, you realize, of the local law enforcement
dd_dr_stg2_pg1_para2="Look lively, boys!" Karengo is the only person still standing. "Your chariot awaits!" In short order, he double-checks the jetpacks on the backs of each of the men, or "Dragonriders", as they creatively branded themselves during their first night of the voyage. Karengo opens the side hatch and hurls the Dragonriders out the door before himself following.
dd_dr_stg2_pg1_para3=You land and pull up every external camera you have to watch the action.
dd_dr_stg2_pg1_opt1=Continue
dd_dr_stg2_pg2_para1=The dragons of ${planetName} you saw as a kid were different from the dragons of mythology, but the beasts you see today aren't quite the same ones you remember learning about on "The Xenofauna Channel", either. For one, the creatures outside your window are largely invisible - a trick of the way the light reflects around the scales on their hides. They are faster, too, or perhaps the ones on "Xenofauna" had been drugged to make them easier to film. A quick survey of the scene shows that Karengo has tagged three dragons with some sort of paintball gun to make them easier to track. Eight of the Dragonriders are chasing the largest one, which is missing part of a tooth and has some blackened scales from where it hit your shield. The last Dragonrider is nowhere in sight.
dd_dr_stg2_pg2_para2=Suddenly, proximity sensors go off on the starboard side and a camera shows something - or someone - bounce off your shield and tumble down the mountainside.
dd_dr_stg2_pg2_opt1=Announce that you're leaving
dd_dr_stg2_pg2_opt2=Stay
dd_dr_stg2_pg2_opt3=Take off, leaving everybody else behind
dd_dr_stg2_pg3_para1=Upon closer inspection, the object rolling down the hill is indeed a body. You turn away and back to the monitors, where one of the Dragonriders is keeping just above a dragon, attempting to lower himself down. The dragon rolls in midair, its wing catching the man and sending him flying. Fortunately for him, a leafy tree branch prevents any further physical harm. Meanwhile, a second dragon is pursuing another Dragonrider.
dd_dr_stg2_pg3_opt1=Get everyone out of there
dd_dr_stg2_pg3_opt2=Take off, leaving everybody else behind
dd_dr_stg2_pg-abandon_para1="The ship takes off with a roar at your touch. Between the cries of the dragons, the sound of the engines, and the air rushing past, you can barely hear the fear and betrayal in the voices of the men you've left behind.
dd_dr_stg2_pg-abandon_opt1=Exit
dd_dr_stg2_pg4_para1=You turn on the PA system. "WE ARE LEAVING," you blast to the survivors, "GET ON BOARD."
dd_dr_stg2_pg4_para2=The defeated Dragonriders need no further encouragement. They beeline for the hatch and you drop a section of the shield to let them through, where they collapse, wide-eyed and panting. Karengo isn't with them. You turn to ask about him, when a flicker of motion on a monitor catches your eye.
dd_dr_stg2_pg4_para3=Karengo is there, and he's riding a dragon, gripping the ridge of scales around its neck. The dragon is frantically trying to get him off, but creative application of his jetpack is, for now, keeping him on top of the beast. He lets out wild whoops of triumph as they soar through the sky and at last you can understand the appeal of this whole mission. Your admiration is cut short by two catastrophic crashes on either side of the ship and accompanying sirens. The dragons are trying to get through.
dd_dr_stg2_pg4_opt1=Take off
dd_dr_stg2_pg4_opt2=Swear and take off
dd_dr_stg2_pg4_opt2_para1="Pignuts," you mutter to yourself.
dd_dr_stg2_pg5_para1=The ship takes off quickly enough to make you temporarily light-headed. "GET ON!" shouts one of the men over the PA as you position the ship just below the raging dragon with Karengo attached. Scales bounce off the roof like diamonds. He lets go of his death grip on the dragon and free falls toward you, only slowing at the last possible moment before dropping through the top hatch. You hit the engines hard and they respond enthusiastically, rocketing you away from the mountain${ifColonized}. From the cabin comes the sound of back-slapping and, surprisingly, a sob.
dd_dr_stg2_pg5_para1_ifColonized=\ and into the safety of patrolled airspace
dd_dr_stg2_pg5_opt1=Leave to take the men back home
#
#### Stage 3: Back Home ####
dd_dr_stg3_pg1_para1=As you land and fuel up, Karengo herds the seven surviving men out of the ship. "Meet us at the bar, yeah?" he says to you. "This day deserves a celebration." You nod, but can't help but notice red eyes and wet cheeks among the rest of the Dragonriders as they shuffle off.
dd_dr_stg3_pg1_opt1=Continue
dd_dr_stg3_pg2_para1=Later that day, you spot the Dragonriders at a corner table of the bar. The men, with the exception of Karengo, appear subdued.
dd_dr_stg3_pg2_para2="How goes it, ${playerLastName}?" he asks. "We were just raising a glass to mission success - made possible by you, of course. Great flying, brother." The bartender arrives with a round of drinks and Karengo raises one. "To the Dragonriders!" he says.
dd_dr_stg3_pg2_opt1="To the Dragonriders!"
dd_dr_stg3_pg2_opt2="To our fallen friends!"
dd_dr_stg3_pg2_opt2_para1=Karengo gives you an unreadable look and lowers his glass.
dd_dr_stg3_pg2_opt3="I'm good, thanks."
dd_dr_stg3_pg2_opt3_para1=Karengo gives you an unreadable look and lowers his glass.
dd_dr_stg3_pg3_para1="Your payment, plus Bolek and Jarek's signup fees. ${rewardCredits}."
dd_dr_stg3_pg3_opt1="Thanks."
dd_dr_stg3_pg3_opt2="I can't accept their money. It's not right."
dd_dr_stg3_pg3_opt2_para1=Karengo shrugs and doesn't take it back.
dd_dr_stg3_pg4_para1="Maybe I'll see you again sometime, yeah? I'm in need of a pilot with some guts." He nods in your direction, clearly dismissing you.
dd_dr_stg3_pg4_para1_opt1=Leave

#### Stage 1: Bar Event ####
dg_de_stg1_prompt=A boisterous laugh sounds from somewhere behind you. You haven't heard that voice since your ship was attacked by dragons.
dg_de_stg1_startBarEvent=Look around for Karengo
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para1="${playerFirstName}!" A huge hand claps you on the shoulder and spins you around, where you find yourself facing a large, widely grinning man.
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para2="Remember me? Yer the best pilot I've had - that stunt to get us out of ${dragonPlanet}, right out of the dragon's nest? Epic."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para3=A crude, but professional, sign behind him reads, 'Dangerous Games - Karengo's Galactic Adventures'.
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para4="Like it?" Karengo follows your gaze. "Decided to make this an official thing. Well...an unofficial official thing.\nFeds wouldn't understand. Doesn't matter; I need a pilot again, and a good one. You've got a waterproof lander, right?"
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt1="Uh, yeah. I think so."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt2="Of course."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt3="Sorry, mate. You'll have to find another pilot."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_para1=Karengo laughs. "It handles the vacuum of space, yeah? Yer right, it'll be fine. I've got a group of lads and ladies here rarin' to see some quoijuu in heat, right up close'n'personal. They've all got their own subpods, so how's about we load up and head out in the next few hours. Good? Good."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_para2="Oh, nearly forgot. We're headed to <mark>${depthsPlanet}</mark>, in <mark>${depthsSystem}</mark>. Ain't sure who's in charge over there these days, so we might need to grease some palms. Best to keep your eyes open and shields up."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_opt1="We leave at noon!"

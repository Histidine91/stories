# Riley

## Skeleton

girl named Riley needs a ride to see her dying father
rush mission, large payout. enough to buy a ship, but she doesn't know how to fly one.

if too slow, get a message next time you land at a core world with her angry and distraught. she leaves to hitchhike home.

if arrive on time, she tries to give payment, but it's clear that it's hard to part with the money.
- Thank you.
- Where did you get this much money? (it's all that she's made in her life)
- Keep it. I have other ways of making credits.

### Hook

A young woman is moving from captain to captain, looking for transport.

- Ask where the young woman needs to get to.

### Intro

"I need to get to ${rileyDestPlanet} to see my father. He's dying. I have ${rileyCredits} to pay for the journey; please, will you help me? I need to be there in ${rileyTimeLimitDays} at the most." Her eyelids are baggy, her clothes wrinkled, and she holds herself rigidly; signs of desperation, stress, and sleep deprivation.

Your TriPad shows that ${rileyDestPlanet} in ${rileyDestSystem} is ${rileyDestPlanetDistanceLY} LY away and controlled by ${rileyDestPlanetControllingFaction}.

- "I can help you. We'll make haste to reach ${rileyDestPlanet} in time."
  - Her eyes widen, and she opens her mouth twice before words come out. "Thank you! This means the world to me. My name is Riley, by the way. I don't have much luggage; I'll be ready to leave as soon as you are."
- "With that much money, why not buy your own ship?"
  - "I wouldn't know how to fly it, and I don't have time to learn. Please, can you help or not?"
- "I don't have time to take on a passenger right now."
  - She nods, and moves on to another captain to beseech her help instead.

### On x days pass

In the days since Riley came aboard, she has relaxed and cleaned up, nearly unrecognizable from the tired, desperate woman you first saw.

She tells stories of when she was younger, mostly of time shared with her father; of riding the latest TriPonies through the forest, looking for beehives to steal honey from; of the time she broke her ankle hoverboarding a restricted mountain peak, and how he broke the law to hike up and rescue her; of his wild birthday gifts to her each year, always a different piece of clothing with embedded AI that was just shy of what was allowed. She shows you how her shirt warms and constricts if it detects stress, mimicking a hug.


### On arrival in system

As you neared ${rileyDestSystem}, she told you about the last time she saw her father. He had become focused on his work - research into safe AI - and they hadn't seen each other for years. She had become a well-known DJ back on ${rileyOriginPlanet} and had a break in her touring schedule, so she made contact and they met halfway. They spent most of a week together, reliving old times.

He'd cried when it was time to leave, and she had, too, but life went on, and it was years before she heard from him again. His message nearly broke her. "Ri, please come as soon as you can. I may not have long, and wish to hold your hand one more time. All love, Dad."


### On arrival on planet

Riley directs you to a pad near her old home, and you land the shuttle. She starts toward the door, then pauses and turns around with a self-conscious, but oddly sad, chuckle.

"Right - your payment. ${rileyCredits}, as promised."

- "Thank you, and good luck." (leave)

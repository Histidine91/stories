## Skeleton

girl named Riley needs a ride to see her dying father
rush mission, large payout. enough to buy a ship, but she doesn't know how to fly one.

if too slow, get a message next time you land at a core world with her angry and distraught. she leaves to hitchhike home.

if arrive on time, she tries to give payment, but it's clear that it's hard to part with the money.

- Where did you get this much money? (it's all that she's made in her life)
- Keep it. I have other ways of making credits.

## Story

### Hook

A young woman is moving from captain to captain, looking for transport.

- Ask where the young woman needs to get to.

### Intro

"I need to get to ${rileyDestPlanet} to see my father. He's dying. I have ${rileyCredits} to pay for the journey; please, will you help me? I need to be there in ${rileyTimeLimitDays} at the most." Her eyelids are baggy, her clothes wrinkled, and she holds herself rigidly; signs of desperation, stress, and sleep deprivation.

Your TriPad shows that ${rileyDestPlanet} is ${rileyDestPlanetDist} LY away and controlled by ${rileyDestPlanetController}.

- "I can help you. We'll make haste to reach ${rileyDestPlanet} in time."
  - Her eyes widen and she opens her mouth twice before words come out. "Thank you! This means the world to me. My name is Riley, by the way. I don't have much luggage; I'll be ready to leave as soon as you are."
- "With that much money, why not buy your own ship?"
  - "I wouldn't know how to fly it, and I don't have time to learn. Please, can you help or not?"
- "I don't have time to take on a passenger right now."
  - She nods, and moves on to another captain to beseech her help instead.
